<h1>About Us:</h1>

<b>ZealX Organization</b> is a community of people with the greatest minds in AI and technology.



<h1>Trusix</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3>
Trusix is an audio analytical model framework repository; being made by organisation ZealX with its head as Zealous. The final model has the capability to comprehend and generate audio based on pattern. This AI model can be used on multiple platforms whichever involves comprehension and generation of audio. The model can comprehend audio (able to analyse) and also generate specific audio according to the requirement. The model is still in its development phase. The model can be used in multiple fields such as generation of music, understanding a unique sound, TTS (Text-To-Speech), STT (Speech-To-Text), generation of unique sounds for development purposes and much more. This model is completely original. 


<h3>Stages of Trusix:</h3> 

Trusix still has a long way to go. We are almost 75% done with making of the model. Once making of the model is done, we need to make a way so that users can access our work. Hence, a website is supposed to be made so that it can be easily accessed. Also, the model needs good amount of processing power no matter how much we try to reduce it and also for the hosting of website and management of the website, we need some specific amount of money so in total we at least need $5000. To get this much, our best option is to use our model in such a way that, we produce audio and post it online and also sell the audio generated to people who might need it. This money would be earned while the website and improvement of model is being done. Once all of this is done, we finally put it online and advertise it.
